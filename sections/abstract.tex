Bithoven is a music information application, specializing in classical music. It
contains performances, composers, and more, and allows users to navigate its
database to create personal playlists.

In this report, we discuss the different kinds of NoSQL databases; their
advantages and disadvantages, common database systems of the different types,
with the purpose of finding the most suitable type of NoSQL database to develop
Bithoven with.

We choose graph databases, and implement the application with Neo4j. We explain
in detail what functionality the application provides, and use it to argue why
our decision is the best fit.
