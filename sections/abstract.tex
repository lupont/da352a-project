Bithoven is a music information application, specializing in classical music. It
contains performances, composers, and more, and allows users to navigate its
database to create personal playlists.

In this report, we introduce the NoSQL concept and basic terms connected to the
phenomenon. We discuss the different kinds of NoSQL databases; their advantages
and disadvantages, common database systems of the different types, with the
purpose of finding the most suitable type of NoSQL database to develop Bithoven
with.

We choose graph databases, and implement the application with Neo4j. We express
our rationale behind choosing this over the other types, and the negative parts
of our choice. We explain in detail what functionality the application provides,
and use it to argue why our decision is the best fit.
