\subsection{Bithoven}
\label{project-description-bithoven}
Bithoven is a music streaming service, specializing in classical music. A common
problem with existing music streaming services is their lack of support for
metadata usually required for classical music. Things like composer, conductor,
soloist(s), multipart pieces, etc. are often nowhere to be found. Enter:
Bithoven.

Users of Bithoven will be able to sign into their account in order to search
pieces using the formerly mentioned metadata. That way, if the user listens to
a piece and enjoys a specific part of it, they will be able to quickly find out
who was responsible for it and can explore their other pieces. The users will
also be able to create playlists and favorites, containing any pieces they like.
